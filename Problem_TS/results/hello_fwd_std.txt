And a million miles
Anymore
At least I can say that I've tried
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
But I ain't done much healing
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
But when I call, you never seem to be home
But when I call, you never seem to be home
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello from the other side
Hello from the other side (Other side)
Hello from the outside
--Hello from the outside (Outside)
Hello from the outside (Outside)
Hello, how are you?
Hello, it's me
I hope that you're well
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
I must've called a thousand times
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
Ooh-ooh, anymore
Ooh-ooh, anymore
Ooh-ooh-ooh, anymore
s
So hello from the other side (Other side)
sTo tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
There's such a difference between us
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
To go over everything
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
When we were younger and free
