They say that time's supposed to heal ya
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
At least I can say that I've tried
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
Hello from the other side (Other side)
So hello from the other side (Other side)
Hello from the other side
--Hello from the outside (Outside)
Hello from the outside (Outside)
Hello from the outside
When we were younger and free
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
But when I call, you never seem to be home
But when I call, you never seem to be home
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, it's me
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Ooh-ooh, anymore
Ooh-ooh-ooh, anymore
Ooh-ooh, anymore
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Anymore
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
To go over everything
But I ain't done much healing
I hope that you're well
s
And a million miles
I must've called a thousand times
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
There's such a difference between us
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
sTo tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
