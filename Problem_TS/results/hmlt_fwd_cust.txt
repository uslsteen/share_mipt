And, as I think, they have already order
And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
And, as the world were now but to begin,

And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away

And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
And bear it to the chapel.
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet

And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe

And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,

And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,

And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
And live the purer with the other half,
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
And makes each petty artire in this body
And makes us rather bear those ills we have

And many such-like as's of great charge,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.

King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,

King. O, for two special reasons,
King. O Gertrude, come away!
King. O heavy deed!
King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
King. Our son shall win.

King. So you shall;
King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
