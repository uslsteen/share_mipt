Why seems it so particular with thee?
For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,

Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
All given to mine ear.
Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
  And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
